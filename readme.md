#Webkitdragdrop

This is a fork of the original webkitdragdrop library by Tommaso Buvoli. My (cybear) modifications to it are: 

* Give element(s) as argument when running callback functions.
* Used textmate's bundle Javascript's Reformat Document to tidy up a little.

##Description
Because this library was designed to run without requiring any other libraries, several basic helper functions were implemented

6 helper functons in this webkit_tools class have been taked directly from Prototype 1.6.1 (http://prototypejs.org/) (c) 2005-2009 Sam Stephenson
