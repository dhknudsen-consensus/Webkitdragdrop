#Webkitdragdrop

This is a fork of the original webkitdragdrop library by Tommaso Buvoli. I've added it to my (cybear) repos on github to make some modifications to it.

##Description
Because this library was designed to run without requiring any other libraries, several basic helper functions were implemented

6 helper functons in this webkit_tools class have been taked directly from Prototype 1.6.1 (http://prototypejs.org/) (c) 2005-2009 Sam Stephenson
